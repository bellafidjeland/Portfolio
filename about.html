        <p>Hello there, my name is Bella Fidjeland. I am a masters student studying strategic communication design (STCM) at University of Colorado Boulder. When I am not busy exploring and designing creative solutions you can probably find me on the ski hill in a spandex suit.</p>
        <p>In my years studying strategic communication design, I have learned that thinking one step ahead and focusing on the future is a fundamental skill in design thinking and it gives me the ability to grow my creative foundation. My emphasis on innovation in product and experience design has taught me to lead by design into the future. My desire is to change the world through design and envision alternative futures. By applying my design-led research tools and methods, I have been able to solve complex social, economic, political, and environmental problems on a local, national and global scale.</p>
        <p>I love exploring the boundaries between design and everyday life. I am inspired by the transformational potential of design to effect change in the world and in my individual life. My work showcases design as a process for transforming social relations and contemporary life through design of innovative products and experiences.</p> 
        <p>My work is focused on developing innovative products and experiences that transcend the divide between technology and design. Problem spaces motivate me to explore the possibilities of design to address complex problems through a design thinking process because it gives me the opportunity to design for change. I love approaching problems through a lens of collective creativity while considering issues from multiple perspectives.</p>   
        </p>

        <h5 class="w3-content w3-justify" style="max-width:600px">
            <p>My creative process is built around exploring the possibilities of design to address complex problems through a design thinking process. The concept of a problem space is one that refers to an entire spectrum of variables that coexist in the process of discovering a solution to a problem. This process begins with a working definition of the problem to be solved and is followed by an intermediate stage that identifies, prototypes, and tests a range of possible solutions. The final stage of the process chooses one solution and implements it.
            <p>The experience design process is built around user-centered products, services, concepts, mediated experiences, and information delivering digitally driven solutions that create meaningful interactions. The process consists of the essential activities and deliverables applying critical concepts of empathy in design.</p> 
            <p>In the brand design process, I combine design thinking and design tools to develop brand stories that are relevant and beautiful to humans across touchpoints and various regions of the world. The process creates innovative products with the marketing built around them.</p>
